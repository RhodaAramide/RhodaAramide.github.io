            <p class="p1">The dog or domestic dog <i class="taxonomy order">Canis familiaris</i> or <i class="taxonomy class">Canis lupus 
            familiaris</i> is a domesticated descendant of the wolf which is
            characterized by an upturning tail. The dog is derived from an 
            ancient, extinct wolf, and the modern wolf is the dog's
            nearest living relative. The dog was the first species to be 
            domesticated, by hunter gatherers over 15,000 years ago, 
            before the development of agriculture. </p>

            <p class="p2">Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded
            to a large number of domestic individuals and gained the 
            ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be 
            inadequate for other canids. 
            Over the millennia, <strong>dogs became uniquely adapted to human
            behavior,</strong> and the human-canine bond has been a
            topic of frequent study. </p>
            
            <p class="p3">The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various 
            behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.
            <a href="">Dog breeds</a> vary widely in shape, size, and color. 
            They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding,
            pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the 
            military, companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled 
            people. 
            This influence on human society has given them the 
             sobriquet of <em>"man's best friend"</em>.</p>
