            <h1>Evolution of Dogs</h1>
            <p>
            The Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 
            occurred 65 million years ago and brought an 
            end to the dinosaurs and the appearance of the
            first carnivorans.[20] The name carnivoran is
            given to a member of the order Carnivora. 
            Carnivorans possess a common arrangement of
            teeth called carnassials, in which the first 
            lower molar and the last upper premolar 
            possess blade-like enamel crowns that act 
            similar to a pair of shears for cutting meat.
            This dental arrangement has been modified by 
            adaptation over the past 60 million years for 
            diets composed of meat, for crushing vegetation,
            or for the loss of the carnassial function 
            altogether as in seals, sea lions, and walruses. 
            Today, not all carnivorans are carnivores, such 
            as the insect-eating Aardwolf.

            The carnivoran ancestors of the dog-like 
            caniforms and the cat-like feliforms began 
            their separate evolutionary paths just after
            the end of the dinosaurs. The first members 
            of the dog family Canidae appeared 40 million
            years ago, of which only its subfamily the
            Caninae survives today in the form of the 
            wolf-like and fox-like canines. Within the 
            Caninae, the first members of genus Canis 
            appeared six million years ago, the ancestors
            of modern domestic dogs, wolves, coyotes, and
            golden jackals.

            Domestication
            Main article: Origin of the domestic dog
            The earliest remains generally accepted to 
            be those of a domesticated dog were 
            discovered in Bonn-Oberkassel, Germany. 
            Contextual, isotopic, genetic, and 
            morphological evidence shows that this dog 
            was not a local wolf. The dog was dated to 
            14,223 years ago and was found buried 
            along with a man and a woman, all three 
            having been sprayed with red hematite powder
            and buried under large, thick basalt blocks.
            The dog had died of canine distemper. 
            Earlier remains dating back to 30,000 years 
            ago have been described as Paleolithic dogs 
            but their status as dogs or wolves remains 
            debated because considerable morphological
            diversity existed among wolves during the 
            Late Pleistocene.

            This timing indicates that the dog was the 
            first species to be domesticated in the 
            time of hunter–gatherers, which predates 
            agriculture. DNA sequences show that all
            ancient and modern dogs share a common 
            ancestry and descended from an ancient, 
            extinct wolf population which was distinct
            from the modern wolf lineage. Most dogs 
            form a sister group to the remains of a Late
            Pleistocene wolf found in the Kessleroch 
            cave near Thayngen in the canton of 
            Schaffhausen, Switzerland, which dates to 
            14,500 years ago. The most recent common 
            ancestor of both is estimated to be from 
            32,100 years ago. This indicates that an 
            extinct Late Pleistocene wolf may have been 
            the ancestor of the dog, with the modern 
            wolf being the dog's nearest living relative.
            
            The dog is a classic example of a domestic 
            animal that likely travelled a commensal 
            pathway into domestication. The questions of
            when and where dogs were first domesticated 
            have taxed geneticists and archaeologists 
            for decades. Genetic studies suggest a 
            domestication process commencing over 
            25,000 years ago, in one or several wolf 
            populations in either Europe, the high 
            Arctic, or eastern Asia. In 2021, a 
            literature review of the current evidence 
            infers that the dog was domesticated in 
            Siberia 23,000 years ago by ancient North 
            Siberians, then later dispersed eastward 
            into the Americas and westward across 
            Eurasia.

            Breeds
            Main article: Dog breed
            Further information: Dog type

            Dog breeds show a range of phenotypic variation
            Dogs are the most variable mammal on earth 
            with around 450 globally recognized dog 
            breeds. In the Victorian era, directed 
            human selection developed the modern dog 
            breeds, which resulted in a vast range of 
            phenotypes. Most breeds were derived from 
            small numbers of founders within the last 
            200 years, and since then dogs have 
            undergone rapid phenotypic change and were 
            formed into today's modern breeds due to 
            artificial selection imposed by humans. 
            The skull, body, and limb proportions vary 
            significantly between breeds, with dogs 
            displaying more phenotypic diversity than 
            can be found within the entire order of 
            carnivores. These breeds possess distinct 
            traits related to morphology, which include 
            body size, skull shape, tail phenotype, fur 
            type and colour. Their behavioural traits 
            include guarding, herding, and hunting, 
            retrieving, and scent detection. Their 
            personality traits include hypersocial 
            behavior, boldness, and aggression, which 
            demonstrates the functional and behavioral 
            diversity of dogs. As a result, today dogs 
            are the most abundant carnivore species and
            are dispersed around the world. The most 
            striking example of this dispersal is that 
            of the numerous modern breeds of European 
            lineage during the Victorian era.
