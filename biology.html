                <h1> Skeleton</h1>
                <p>
            A lateral view of a dog skeleton
                All healthy dogs, regardless of their 
                size and type, have an identical 
                skeletal structure with the exception 
                of the number of bones in the tail, 
                although there is significant skeletal 
                variation between dogs of different 
                types. The dog's skeleton is well
                adapted for running; the vertebrae on 
                the neck and back have extensions for 
                powerful back muscles to connect to, 
                the long ribs provide plenty of room for 
                the heart and lungs, and the shoulders 
                are unattached to the skeleton allowing 
                great flexibility.

                Compared to the dog's wolf-like ancestors,
                selective breeding since domestication
                has seen the dog's skeleton greatly 
                enhanced in size for larger types as 
                mastiffs and miniaturised for smaller 
                types such as terriers; dwarfism has been 
                selectively utilised for some types where 
                short legs are advantageous such as 
                dachshunds and corgis. Most dogs naturally
                have 26 vertebrae in their tails, but some 
                with naturally short tails have as few as 
                three.

                The dog's skull has identical components 
                regardless of breed type, but there is 
                significant divergence in terms of skull
                shape between types. The three basic 
                skull shapes are the elongated 
                dolichocephalic type as seen in 
                sighthounds, the intermediate 
                mesocephalic or mesaticephalic type, and 
                the very short and broad brachycephalic 
                type exemplified by mastiff type skulls.

                <p>
                A dog's senses include vision, hearing,
                smell, taste, touch, and sensitivity to 
                Earth's magnetic field. Another study 
                has suggested that dogs can see Earth's 
                magnetic field. </p>

                <h1>Coat</h1>
                <p>
                Dogs display wide variation in coat type,
                density, length, color, and composition
                The coats of domestic dogs are of two 
                varieties: "double" being familiar with 
                dogs (as well as wolves) originating 
                from colder climates, made up of a 
                coarse guard hair and a soft down hair, 
                or "single", with the topcoat only. 
                Breeds may have an occasional "blaze",
                stripe, or "star" of white fur on their 
                chest or underside. Premature graying 
                can occur in dogs from as early as one 
                year of age; this is associated with 
                impulsive behaviors, anxiety behaviors, 
                fear of noise, and fear of unfamiliar 
                people or animals.

                <h1>Tail</h1>
                <p>
                There are many different shapes for dog 
                tails: straight, straight up, sickle, 
                curled, or corkscrew. As with many 
                canids, one of the primary functions of
                a dog's tail is to communicate their 
                emotional state, which can be crucial 
                in getting along with others. In some 
                hunting dogs the tail is traditionally 
                docked to avoid injuries. </p>

            <section>
                <h1>Health</h1>
                <p>
                Some breeds of dogs are prone to specific
                genetic ailments such as elbow and hip 
                dysplasia, blindness, deafness, pulmonic 
                stenosis, cleft palate, and trick knees. 
                Two severe medical conditions 
                significantly affecting dogs are pyometra,
                affecting unspayed females of all breeds 
                and ages, and Gastric dilatation volvulus 
                (bloat), which affects larger breeds or 
                deep-chested dogs. Both of these are acute 
                conditions and can kill rapidly. Dogs are 
                also susceptible to parasites such as fleas,
                ticks, mites, hookworms, tapeworms, 
                roundworms, and heartworms, which is a 
                roundworm species that lives in the hearts 
                of dogs. </p>
                <p>
                Several human foods and household 
                ingestibles are toxic to dogs, including 
                chocolate solids, causing theobromine 
                poisoning, onions and garlic, causing 
                thiosulphate, sulfoxide or disulfide 
                poisoning, grapes and raisins, macadamia 
                nuts, and xylitol. The nicotine in 
                tobacco can also be dangerous to dogs. 
                Signs of ingestion can include copious 
                vomiting (e.g., from eating cigar butts) or 
                diarrhea. Some other symptoms are abdominal 
                pain, loss of coordination, collapse, or 
                death.</p>
                <p>
                Dogs are also vulnerable to some of the 
                same health conditions as humans, 
                including diabetes, dental and heart 
                disease, epilepsy, cancer, hypothyroidism,
                and arthritis. </p>

            <section id="lifespan">
                <h1>Lifespan</h1>
                <p>
                The typical lifespan of dogs varies 
                widely among breeds, but for most, the 
                median longevity (the age at which half 
                the dogs in a population have died and 
                half are still alive) ranges from 10 to 
                13 years. The median longevity of 
                mixed-breed dogs, taken as an average of 
                all sizes, is one or more years longer than 
                that of purebred dogs when all breeds are 
                averaged. For dogs in England, increased 
                body weight has been found to be negatively
                correlated with longevity (i.e., the heavier
                the dog, the shorter its lifespan), and 
                mixed-breed dogs live on average 1.2 years 
                longer than purebred dogs. </p>

                <h1>Reproduction</h1>

                <p>
                In domestic dogs, sexual maturity 
                happens around six months to one year 
                for both males and females, although 
                this can be delayed until up to two 
                years of age for some large breeds, and 
                is the time at which female dogs will 
                have their first estrous cycle. They 
                will experience subsequent estrous cycles
                semiannually, during which the body 
                prepares for pregnancy. At the peak of 
                the cycle, females will become estrous, 
                mentally and physically receptive to 
                copulation. Because the ova survive and 
                can be fertilized for a week after 
                ovulation, more than one male can sire 
                the same litter. </p>
                <p>
                Fertilization typically occurs two to 
                five days after ovulation; 14â€“16 days 
                after ovulation, the embryo attaches to 
                the uterus and after seven to eight more
                days, a heartbeat is detectable. </p>
                <p>
                Dogs bear their litters roughly 58 to 68
                days after fertilization, with an 
                average of 63 days, although the length
                of gestation can vary. An average litter
                consists of about six puppies. </p>
            </section>
            <section id="neutering">
                <h1>Neutering</h1>
                <p>
                Neutering refers to the sterilization of
                animals, usually by removing the male's 
                testicles or the female's ovaries and 
                uterus, to eliminate the ability to 
                procreate and reduce sex drive. Because 
                of dogs' overpopulation in some countries,
                many animal control agencies, such as the 
                American Society for the Prevention of 
                Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), advise that 
                dogs not intended for further breeding 
                should be neutered, so that they do not 
                have undesired puppies that may later be 
                euthanized. </p>
                <p>
                According to the Humane Society of the 
                United States, three to four million dogs
                and cats are euthanized each year. Many 
                more are confined to cages in shelters 
                because there are many more animals than 
                there are homes. Spaying or castrating 
                dogs helps keep overpopulation down. </p>
                <p>
                Neutering reduces problems caused by 
                hypersexuality, especially in male dogs.
                Spayed female dogs are less likely to 
                develop cancers affecting the mammary 
                glands, ovaries, and other reproductive 
                organs. However, neutering increases the
                risk of urinary incontinence in female 
                dogs and prostate cancer in males and 
                osteosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, cruciate 
                ligament rupture, obesity, and diabetes 
                mellitus in either sex. </p>

                <h1>Inbreeding depression</h1>
                <p>
                A common breeding practice for pet dogs
                is mating between close relatives 
                (e.g., between half and full siblings).
                Inbreeding depression is considered to 
                be due mainly to the expression of 
                homozygous deleterious recessive 
                mutations. Outcrossing between unrelated
                individuals, including dogs of different
                breeds, results in the beneficial masking
                of deleterious recessive mutations in 
                progeny. </p>
                <p>
                In a study of seven dog breeds 
                (the Bernese Mountain Dog, Basset Hound,
                Cairn Terrier, Brittany, German Shepherd
                Dog, Leonberger, and West Highland White
                Terrier), it was found that inbreeding 
                decreases litter size and survival.
                Another analysis of data on 42,855 
                Dachshund litters found that as the 
                inbreeding coefficient increased, litter
                size decreased and the percentage of 
                stillborn puppies increased, thus 
                indicating inbreeding depression. In a 
                study of Boxer litters, 22% of puppies 
                died before reaching 7 weeks of age. 
                Stillbirth was the most frequent cause 
                of death, followed by infection. 
                Mortality due to infection increased 
                significantly with increases in 
                inbreeding.  </p>
