                <h1> Population </h1>
                <p>
                The dog is probably the most widely abundant
                large carnivoran living in the human 
                environment. In 2013, the estimated global 
                dog population was between 700 million and 
                987 million. About 20% of dogs live as pets 
                in developed countries. In the developing 
                world, dogs are more commonly feral or 
                communally owned, with pet dogs uncommon. 
                Most of these dogs live their lives as 
                scavengers and have never been owned by 
                humans, with one study showing their most 
                common response when approached by strangers
                is to run away (52%) or respond aggressively
                (11%). Little is known about these dogs, or
                the dogs in developed countries that are 
                feral, strays, or are in shelters because 
                the great majority of modern research on dog
                cognition has focused on pet dogs living in 
                human homes. </p>

                <h1>Competitors and predators</h1>
                <p>
                Although dogs are the most abundant and 
                widely distributed terrestrial carnivores,
                feral and free-ranging dogs' potential to 
                compete with other large carnivores is 
                limited by their strong association with 
                humans. For example, a review of the 
                studies in dogs' competitive effects on 
                sympatric carnivores did not mention any 
                research on competition between dogs and 
                wolves.[79][80] Although wolves are known 
                to kill dogs, they tend to live in pairs 
                or in small packs in areas where they are 
                highly persecuted, giving them a 
                disadvantage facing large dog groups.
                </p>
                <p>
                Wolves kill dogs wherever they are found
                together. In some instances, wolves have
                displayed an uncharacteristic 
                fearlessness of humans and buildings 
                when attacking dogs to the extent that 
                they have to be beaten off or killed.
                Although the numbers of dogs killed each
                year are relatively low, it induces a 
                fear of wolves entering villages and 
                farmyards to take dogs and losses of 
                dogs to wolves have led to demands for 
                more liberal wolf hunting regulations.
                </p>
                <p>
                Coyotes and big cats have also been 
                known to attack dogs. In particular, 
                leopards are known to have a preference 
                for dogs and have been recorded to kill 
                and consume them, no matter what their 
                size. Siberian tigers in the Amur 
                River region have killed dogs in the
                middle of villages. This indicates that
                the dogs were targeted. Amur tigers will
                not tolerate wolves as competitors 
                within their territories, and the tigers
                could be considering dogs in the same 
                way. Striped hyenas are known to kill 
                dogs in their range.

                <p>
                Dogs have been described as omnivores.
                Compared to wolves, dogs from 
                agricultural societies have extra copies
                of amylase and other genes involved in 
                starch digestion that contribute to an 
                increased ability to thrive on a 
                starch-rich diet. Similar to humans, 
                some dog breeds produce amylase in their
                saliva and are classified as having a 
                high starch diet. However, more like 
                cats and less like other omnivores, dogs
                can only produce bile acid with taurine 
                and they cannot produce vitamin D, which
                they obtain from animal flesh. Also, 
                more like cats, dogs require arginine to
                maintain its nitrogen balance. These 
                nutritional requirements place dogs 
                halfway between carnivores and omnivores.

                As a domesticated or semi-domesticated 
                animal, the dog is nearly universal among
                human societies. Notable exceptions once

                        The Andamanese peoples, who were

                        Individual Pacific islands whose
                        maritime settlers did not bring 
                        dogs, or where dogs died out 
                        after original settlement,

                        Palau and most of the Caroline

                        Chatham Islands and Pitcairn 
                        Island (settled by the Bounty 
                        mutineers, who killed off their 
                        dogs to escape discovery by

                Dogs were introduced to Antarctica as 
                sled dogs, but were later outlawed by 
                international agreement due to the 
                possible risk of spreading infections.
